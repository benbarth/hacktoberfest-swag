- [ ] I've read the [Contributing.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file
- [ ] I do not intend to make low-value changes, just for swag. I am aware, that my PR could otherwise be flagged as `spam` or `invalid` and may lead to a permanent exclusion from the Hacktoberfest event.

### Adding a new Hacktoberfest participant

- [ ] I did not edit the README.md file by hand
- [ ] I made sure, that the new participant has not already been added
- [ ] I'm not adding a company from the [blocklist](../.gitignore)

### Editing an existing Hacktoberfest participant

- [ ] I did not edit the README.md file by hand
- [ ] I made proper changes to the existing participant.yml file
