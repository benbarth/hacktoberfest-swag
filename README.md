## What is Hacktoberfest?

"Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software." - _DigitalOcean_

Hacktoberfest® encourages participation in the open source community.

## Official Participation

Register at [hacktoberfest.com](https://hacktoberfest.com/).

* Register anytime between September 26 and October 31
* Pull requests can be made in any GitHub or GitLab hosted project that’s participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic)
* Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total
* The first 50,000 participants to have their first PR/MR accepted will have a tree planted in their name through Tree Nation
* Participants with four pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 will receive a unique digital reward

## Additional Swag Opportunities

In all of the Hacktoberfest excitement, many companies want to join the celebration by rewarding their contributors with even more swag! That's why we're here!

### The purpose of this list is to incentivize meaningful contributions. If you intend to make low-value changes -- just for swag. *Don't.*

QUANTITY IS FUN, QUALITY IS KEY
